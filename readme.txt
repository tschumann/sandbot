Sandbot

== About ==

Name: Sandbot
Description: A multiplayer bot for Half-Life, Half-Life Opposing Force (Deathmatch and Capture the Flag), Day of Defeat (Territorial Control), Gunman Chronicles, Natural Selection (Combat) and They Hunger (there is work in progress support for Team Fortress Classic, Natural Selection (Classic) and The Ship). It is based off HPB_Bot by botman (see HPB_Bot_ReadMe.txt).
Requirements: Steam versions of the supported games or mods.
Installation: Copy the files into your Steam/steamapps/common/Half-Life directory

Sandbot will work with Metamod for all games and mods (except for with Gunman Chronicles due to a bug in Metamod itself).
Sandbot should work with Metamod-P for all games and mods but has been found to freeze even without Sandbot on Ubuntu.

== Usage ==

addbot		Add a bot to the server
		In Day of Defeat you can addbot allies or addbot axis
		In Natural Selection you can addbot alien or addbot marine
bot_skill [1-5]	Set the bot skill level (1 is highest skill)
waypoint add	Add a waypoint
waypoint delete	Delete a waypoint
waypoint save	Write waypoints to file

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q. Can you add support for mod x?
A. I'm not planning to at the moment - I'm planning support for Half-Life, Opposing Force, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, Gunman Chronicles, Natural Selection, The Ship and They Hunger which is likely going to take a while.

Q. Is the WON version supported?
A. No, Sandbot will only work with the Steam version.

Q. Can it be used for dedicated servers?
A. It should work but I don't test it.

Q. Can I make some waypoints?
A. Yes, please do!

Q. How do I run the tests?
A. In Visual Studio go to Tests -> Windows -> Test Explorer and in the run icon menu choose Run All.

Q. Can you fix Sandbot not working on my distro?
A. Unless it's a fairly recent version of Ubuntu, probably not - it's enough work keeping it running on two platforms. Recompiling on your distro should hopefully sort it out - let someone know if it won't compile.

Q. I get an error on Linux: "LoadLibrary failed on sandbot.so: ./libstdc++.so.6: version `CXXABI_1.3.9' not found"
A. Steam and SteamCMD both come packaged with older version of libstdc++ - move this version out of the way so Sandbot can load the version you've installed with your distro's package manager.
